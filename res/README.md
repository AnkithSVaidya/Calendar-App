README
1. Instructions on how to run your program (using the jar file from the terminal).
    1. Please run in terminal using either:
        1. java -jar assignment_6_app.jar --mode interactive. Interactive mode will allow a user to
           enter commands line by line. Note that invalid commands will throw an error and exit the
           program.
        2. java -jar assignment_6_app.jar --mode headless commands.txt. Headless mode will allow a
           user to submit a list of commands in a text file. This input will accept the relative path of
           the file.
       3. java -jar assignment_5_app.jar. GUI mode will allow a user to interact with a calendar GUI.
